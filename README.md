# Artificial-Intelligence-Teacher

Note:
I have created this readme file for reference during the amazon interview the day before.Please apologize if unable to understand :)
Platform: Google AIY kit(Voice)
Language: Python

Google aiy kit is nothing but a project built on Raspberry pi Zero along with GPU and other devices(mic obviously for voice kit,camera for vision kit)
Being a social company,we worked on projects focused on government schools.
We were helped with free Google AIY kits,google coral,AWS deeplens,Kano kits.We were even appreciated by google india head :)
This programs asks questions to each and every kid and,puts marks for each kid and finally appreciates the kid who answers more questions.
Issues faced:
Google voice kit mic found it difficult to infer few names and gave wrong to right answers :)
So,we tried to keep the questions with answers as simple as possible


I shall update this readme later.Thanks
